"The `INSPIRE Directive <https://inspire.ec.europa.eu>`__ aims to create a "
"European Union spatial data infrastructure (SDI) for the purposes of "
"environmental policies. This European SDI will enable the sharing of "
"environmental spatial information among public sector organisations, "
"facilitate public access to spatial information and assist in policy-making "
"across boundaries.  INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial "
"information established and operated by the 28 Member States of the European"
" Union. The Directive addresses 34 spatial data themes needed for "
"environmental applications.  It came into force on 15 May 2007 and will be "
"implemented in various stages, with full implementation required by 2021. "
"INSPIRE is on a technical level based on international standards, mainly "
"those developed by the :doc:`OGC <ogc_overview>` and ISO."

"Currently, more than 7,000 institutions contribute their data to INSPIRE. A "
"significant share of them use OSGeo applications throughout the "
"implementation process. :doc:`OSGeoLive <../index>` provides an easy entry "
"to the implementation process through an increasing number of readily "
"available examples with sample data European data from multiple application "
"domains. In addition, a dedicated wiki page on `INSPIRE and OSGeo "
"<https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/INSPIRE>`__ is established that gives an "
"overview of the legal and technical aspects of INSPIRE together with "
"selected use cases and an overview of OSGeo tools that implementers may use."
